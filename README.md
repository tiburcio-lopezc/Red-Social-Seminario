Task:
Social network (part one)!
The first part of a social network is to be implemented, which consists of creating the registration, authentication, and photo uploading module.

During registration, data input must be required in order to ensure that it is not a robot.
During authentication, the creation of a secure session and secure handling of user data must be ensured.
In the photo upload module, users should be allowed to upload photos, limiting the upload of images larger than 2MB. 
If images larger than the mentioned limit are received, the quality of the image should be automatically reduced.




Future changes:

Add a frontend with react

Do automated testing with cypress

Deploying with docker
